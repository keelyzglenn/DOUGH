## Description

This webpage demonstrates my ability to combine my four weeks of learning at Epicodus. This webpage has a "Home" page with images that toggle to the next, an "About Us" page that gives a history of the company, and an "Order Online" page that allows the user to pick a pizza size, toppings, and delivery information which will result in a total balance due for the user.
